A C++ CLI project to help you keep track of any given clue game and have an absolute answer in the shortest amount of time possible.

This project uses ncurses as a CLI and gtest for testing. If you'd like to compile this on your local machine, you must first install the ncurses library and the gtest library. Here are instructions in case you don't know how.
